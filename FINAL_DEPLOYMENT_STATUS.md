## 🎯 FINAL PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Phase 1: Production Secrets (CRITICAL - Do This First)
- [ ] **Database**
  - [ ] Create PostgreSQL database on production server (e.g., Render, AWS RDS)
  - [ ] Update `DATABASE_URL` in production .env (do NOT commit)
  - [ ] Test connection from Render dashboard

- [ ] **Authentication Secrets**
  - [ ] Update `JWT_SECRET` with strong random value
  - [ ] Update `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` with strong random value
  - [ ] Update `JWT_ADMIN_SECRET` with strong random value
  - [ ] Update `CORS_ORIGIN` to production domain

- [ ] **Third-Party Services**
  - [ ] **Stripe**: Replace test keys with LIVE keys (`sk_live_xxx`, `pk_live_xxx`)
  - [ ] **SendGrid**: Add API key for email delivery
  - [ ] **Google OAuth**: Add production credentials (get from Google Cloud Console)
  - [ ] **Sentry**: Add production DSN for error tracking

### Phase 2: Testing (Do This Before Deployment)
- [ ] **Functional Tests**
  - [ ] User signup & login
  - [ ] Browse rooms → add to booking → checkout → payment
  - [ ] Browse menu → add to cart → checkout
  - [ ] Admin login & dashboard operations
  - [ ] Create/edit/delete room with photos
  - [ ] Create/edit/delete menu item with photos
  - [ ] Create/edit/delete hall with photos

- [ ] **Mobile Testing**
  - [ ] Test on iPhone (iOS)
  - [ ] Test on Android phone
  - [ ] Test on tablet
  - [ ] Verify touch interactions

- [ ] **Browser Testing**
  - [ ] Chrome (latest)
  - [ ] Firefox (latest)  
  - [ ] Safari (macOS)
  - [ ] Edge (Windows)

- [ ] **Security Testing**
  - [ ] Test rate limiting (too many requests → 429)
  - [ ] Test invalid JWT token (should reject)
  - [ ] Test SQL injection prevention (Zod validation)
  - [ ] Test CORS (wrong origin → rejected)

### Phase 3: Deployment (Execute in This Order)
1. [ ] Create production PostgreSQL database and update DATABASE_URL
2. [ ] Set all production environment variables in Render dashboard
3. [ ] Do NOT commit `.env` file to repository
4. [ ] In Render dashboard → Web Service → Manual Deploy
5. [ ] Monitor backend logs for startup errors
6. [ ] Test API endpoints at production URL
7. [ ] Test full user flow on production
8. [ ] Monitor logs for errors/warnings
9. [ ] Set up monitoring alerts (if using Sentry)

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment (First 24 Hours)
- [ ] Monitor error logs (Sentry/Loggly)
- [ ] Check database connections working
- [ ] Verify backups are running
- [ ] Test email notifications being sent
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Have rollback plan ready

## 📞 DEPLOYMENT SUPPORT

### If Backend won't start on Render:
```
1. Check Render logs (Render Dashboard → Logs)
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
3. Ensure all required env vars are set
4. Check Node version (should be 16+)
5. Verify npm install completed successfully
```

### If Frontend can't connect to API:
```
1. Verify VITE_API_URL is correct
2. Check CORS headers in backend
3. Look for errors in browser console (F12)
4. Verify backend is actually running (check /api/docs)
```

### If Payments not working:
```
1. Verify Stripe keys are PRODUCTION keys (not test)
2. Check webhook configuration in Stripe dashboard
3. Test with Stripe test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
4. Ensure CORS_ORIGIN includes payment domain
```
